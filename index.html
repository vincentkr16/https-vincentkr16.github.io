            <legend>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why</legend>
            <p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is <b>CMSC 22</b> because it is extremely enjoyable. The project that I did with my partner got
                an almost perfect score and that made me happy. I actually learned a lot in that subject and I hope that it will help
                me on higher CMSC subjects that I will take soon.

        <fieldset>
            <legend>Favorite GE so far and why</legend>
            <p>My favorite GE so far is <b>KAS 1</b> because the class was able to narrow down the specific issues and taboos that involve Philippine historical events.
                It was also highly engaging in terms of getting our personal perceptions on various ideologies that ignited differences among the students.

        <fieldset>
            <legend>Favorite programming language so far and why</legend>
            <p><b>Java</b> is my favorite programming language so far because it is used for programming applications on web, mobile, desktop, and many more
                which is aligned to my target career after I graduate.
